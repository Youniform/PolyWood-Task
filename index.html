                <p class="bodycopy-text">POLYWOOD outdoor dining sets are designed with your family in mind. We’ve created durable outdoor dining tables and chairs that coordinate perfectly to make sets that can continually meet the dining demands and style preferences of any household. Whether you have a large family and favor a 9-piece outdoor dining set or 7-piece outdoor dining set with a rustic farmhouse design or have a smaller family with more contemporary tastes and desire a 5-piece outdoor dining set, there’s a curated outdoor dining set perfect for you.</p>
                <p class="bodycopy-text"> Our modern outdoor dining sets are not only stylish — they’re sustainable too! All of our outdoor dining table and chairs are constructed from genuine POLYWOOD lumber, a durable material made using recycled ocean-bound and landfill-bound high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. Our HDPE lumber is low-maintenance, easy to clean, can handle any outdoor climate, and keeps our planet healthy.</p>
